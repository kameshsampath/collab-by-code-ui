        <h4 class="mt-4">Collaborate by Code was created by two Red Hat interns, Fiona and Grace, during their 2018 summer internships in our Boston office. </h4>
        <p class="mt-4">
        We loved what they started, so at the end of the intern program, a team of Red Hatters volunteered to continue developing the application to create what you see today. True to its name, Collaborate by Code has been a very collaborative project and a great open source story. Interested in reviewing or contributing to the code? The project is available on the Red Hat Official GitHub.
